  <h1>Parts</h1>

  <h2>Part 1: Phantom Blood</h2>

  <p>Part 1 of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure features our first Jojo, Jonathan Joestar.
    Phantom Blood is mostly about the conflict between Jonathan and his adopted brother, Dio Brando.
    Dio gets adopted into the Joestar family and immediatly hates Jonathan and tries to take
    everything from him. The conflict starts off rather normal (or as normal as Jojo's ever gets)
    but soon enough Dio has used a stone mask to turn into an immortal vampire whose only weakness
    is sunlight so Jonathan must learn Hamon, which is essentially magic sunlight breathing and no
    it doesn't make any more sense in the show, to defeat him.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: Battle Tendency</h2>

    <p>Battle Tendency is where Jojo's really gets interesting. We have moved forward in time many
      years and we have a new protagonist, Joseph Joestar, the grandson of Jonathan Joestar.
      We also learn that the Germans have uncovered the Pillar Men who are a race of incredibly
      powerful beings that originally created the stone mask that Dio used to become a vampire.
      Joseph ends up embarking on a journey to defeat the Pillar Men and save the world.</p>

    <h2>Part 3: Stardust Crusaders</h2>

    <p>Stardust Crusaders features yet another Jojo, Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of Joseph Joestar.
      This part also marks a massive change for the series. Both the previous parts used Hamon for its fights
      but this part introduces Stands which are basically psychic punching ghosts. The plot
      starts with DIO coming back and obtaining a stand which becuase of some shenanigans in part 1
      gives stands to everyone in the Joestar bloodline including Joseph, Jotaro, and Jotaro's mother, Holly.
      Unfortunetly Holly isn't strong enough for the stand and it will kill her unless they can
      defeat DIO in Egypt.</p>

      <h2>Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable</h2>

      <p>In Diamond is Unbreakable we meet Josuke Higashikata who is the illegitimate son of Joseph
        Joestar. This part is differs from the rest in its tone as it is less of a grand adventure
        and a lot smaller scale. Josuke lives in a town called Morioh and the whole part is about
        this town. We learn that stands actually originated from magic arrows and someone is using
        it to create stand users in Morioh. Later in the part we meet the true villian, a sinister
        serial killer named Yoshikage Kira. It comes down to Jotaro and his friends to find and
        defeat this murderer.</p>

      <h2>Part 5: Golden Wind</h2>

      <p>Golden Wind features Giorno Giovanna as the new Jojo and takes place in Italy. Giorno is
        the son of DIO and he wants to become the boss of the mafia in Italy so he can stop
        the spread of drugs that ruin the lives of many. To do so, he joins the mafia and becomes
        part of a team that help him to uncover the mysterious identity of thier boss and defeat him
        while they protect the boss's daughter.</p>
