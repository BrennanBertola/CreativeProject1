  <h1>Char&Stands</h1>

  <h2>Jonathan Joestar</h2>

  <p>Jonathan is the first Jojo that we meet and he's perhaps the most boring. He is a gentleman
    and just a nice guy which is part of why we root for him because Dio essentially ruins
    his life for no good reason. He starts off as a rather timid weakling but over the course
    of Phantom Blood we watch him grow into a much stronger and confident character as he masters
    Hamon to defeat Dio</p>

  <h2>Joseph Joestar</h2>

  <p>Joseph is almost the opposite of Jonathan. While Jonathan was a gentleman, Joseph is more
    of a swindler and will do anything to win fights. He often uses trickery to win fights rather
    than just using strength. When he fights he is always planning ahead and will often call
    out what his opponent will do next. In Stardust Crusaders we see his stand, Hermit Purple.
    Hermit Purple allows him to control vines to attack and defend although he rarely uses it in
    battle. It also has the ability to let him see things from far away using cameras or other objects.
    Joseph is featured in parts 2, 3, and 4.</p>

  <h2>Jotaro Kujo</h2>

  <p>Jotaro is probably the most iconic Jojo. He is essentially the strong and silent type with him
    rarely speaking or saying what he is thinking but he is the strongest in the group that travels
    to Egypt. His stand is Star Platinum which has the ability to punch really fast and really hard.
    His stand is rather lacking compared to later stands and it makes fights at the beginning of
    Stardust Crusaders a little bland as Jotaro usually just wins by puching harder than his opponent
    although as things continue we see Jotaro fighting enemies he can't defeat through pure strenght
    and we see him start to strategize. Jotaro appears in parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 making him the JoJo
    we see the most throughout the series.</p>

  <h2>Josuke Higashikata</h2>

  <p>Josuke is a highschooler and unlike Jotaro he actually acts like one. He has a lot of personality
    and is very sensitive about his hairstyle to the point that if anyone mocks it he will go into
    a blind rage. His stand is Crazy Diamond and it has the power to fix things alhtough he can't use
    it to heal himself. He uses this ability in a lot of interesting ways that don't just
    involve healing people. One of my favorite uses of his power is when he breaks a window and
    turns the shards into projectiles by fixing it.</p>

  <h2>Giorno Giovanna</h2>

  <p>Giorno is probably most notable for his goal to become a Gang Star and his morals. He grew
    up with an abusive stepfather but his life changed one day when saves the life of a gangster.
    After that he was never abused again he started to see that the mafia had real power in the city
    so he desires to become a part of that mafia to make the city a better place. His stand is
    Gold Experience which has the power to turn inanimate objects into living things. This power
    is used in a lot of different ways like how he can heal people by turning rocks into body parts.
    Also at the beginning of Golden Experience, the things he brings to life will reflect any damage
    taken but then that ability just disappears a few episodes in with no explanation.</p>
